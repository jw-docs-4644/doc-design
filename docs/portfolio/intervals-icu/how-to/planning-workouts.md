## Plan your workout in CSV

Modify the file workouts.csv and replace the workouts that are there with your own workouts.

###

The csv file that stores the workouts is kind of picky. Here's a description from Gemini that hopefully catches the nuances of it:

| Requirement | Correct Format | Type | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Date | 2026-02-14 | Required | Places the workout on the correct calendar day. |
| Name & Type | Easy Run, Run | Required | Identifies the sport and title for your watch. |
| The Hyphen (-) | - 10km... | Required | The Trigger: Without a leading hyphen, no bar graph is created. |
| Target Keyword | ...Pace | Required | Forces the watch to use the Pace Gauge instead of HR/Power. |
| Repeat Syntax | Repeat 2x | Required | Creates the nested "skyline" blocks for intervals/hills. |
| Double Quotes | "..." | Required | Wraps the text so \n or , don't break the file structure. |
| Step Distance | - 5km... | Required | Required for Intervals.icu to tally your weekly distance. |
| Broad Ranges | 50-90% Pace | Optional | Prevents the watch from "beeping" if you are off-pace. |
| Step Labels | ...Hill Effort | Optional | Labels the step on your watch screen (e.g., "Hill Effort"). |
| Coaching Notes | Conversational pace | Optional | Extra text for your reference; does not affect the bar graph. |


#### Pro-Tip: The "Zero-Space" Rule

For the Hyphen requirement, ensure your CSV row looks like this: ...Run,"- 5km Z2 Pace..." If there is even one space like this: " - 5km", the system will treat it as a plain note and will not show the bar graph.
